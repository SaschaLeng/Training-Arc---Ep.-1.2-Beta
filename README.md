GTG Loop Tracker

Urban Training Arc’s GTG (Grease the Groove) Loop Tracker is a lightweight, client‑side tool for planning and tracking recurring exercises or habits on a weekly schedule or by category. It runs entirely in your browser, stores data locally, and supports multiple profiles.

Features

Weekly Planner & Overview: Toggle between a day‑based weekly view and a category‑based exercise overview.

Multiple Profiles: Create, switch, and delete profiles to manage separate routines (e.g., “Work”, “Home”, “Travel”).

Preset & Custom Categories: Organize exercises into default groups (e.g., Upper Body, Core) or define your own.

Progress Tracking: Checkboxes for each set; dynamic progress bar shows percent completed.

Import/Export JSON: Backup or share your routines and progress, including categories and view settings.

Responsive UI: Mobile‑friendly, collapsible sections, modals for add/edit, and smooth transitions.




No build steps or dependencies required — pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
